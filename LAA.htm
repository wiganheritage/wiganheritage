Local Area Agreements
<p>Overview<br>
  If you are new to Local Area Agreements, you are likely to be overwhelmed by 
  yet another set of jargon and government plans. But don't despair! It is worth 
  getting to grips with Local Area Agreements. Those that have, have often been 
  rewarded with refreshingly 'real' local plans, which make sense for local communities. 
  There are opportunities to 'make up' (well, negotiate) targets, which make sense 
  for local people you work with, and to do things differently. </p>
<p>What is a Local Area Agreement?<br>
  A Local Area Agreement is a contract negotiated between a local area, (led by 
  the Local Authority through the Local Strategic Partnership,) and central government, 
  (through the local Government Office. </p>
<p>A Local Area Agreement sets out a range of aims, 'an outcomes framework' for 
  improving services to local people, based on local needs and priorities. Although 
  there are some 'mandatory outcomes' required by government, there is much more 
  flexibility for local areas to negotiate their own set of outcomes, targets 
  and performance indicators, based on local needs.</p>
<p>Local Area Agreements do not generally offer new money to Local Authorities, 
  (except where there is a negotiated 'reward element'), but a range of existing 
  funding streams will be included under Local Area Agreements. <br>
  The LAA is agreed by the Local Strategic Partnership (LSP) and in most areas 
  if focuses around four 'blocks';<br>
  &middot; children and young people;<br>
  &middot; safer and stronger communities;<br>
  &middot; healthier communities and older people;<br>
  &middot; economic development and enterprise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What's in a Local Area Agreement?</p>
<p>The LAA for each area includes: </p>
<p>&middot; The outcomes agreed by the area - e.g. 'Reduce crime'<br>
  &middot; The indicators for each outcome - e.g. ' Reduce the proportion of adults 
  and young offenders who re-offend'<br>
  &middot; The baseline for each indicator - e.g. 'in 05/06 45% of young offenders 
  re-offended within 2 years'<br>
  &middot; The targets for each year - e.g. 'in 07/08 the re-offending rate for 
  young offenders within 2 years will reduce to 38%'<br>
  &middot; The lead partner for that indicator- e.g. 'Youth Offending Team'</p>
<p>The Local Area Agreement also includes:</p>
<p>&middot; A statement of how local people and the voluntary and community sector 
  have been involved (the Statement of Community Involvement)<br>
  &middot; Details of the funding streams to be included in the Local Area Agreement<br>
  &middot; Information on how performance will be managed and the monitoring arrangements<br>
  &middot; The roles and responsibilities of each partner.</p>
<p><br>
  Monitoring and review<br>
  Locally Government Office for the North West (GONW) is responsible for negotiating, 
  and then monitoring and review of Local Area Agreements. Once the LAA is agreed 
  it is reviewed every six months, to check progress, and agree action to be taken 
  to address underperformance. </p>
<p></p>
<p> <br>
  How will the new Local Area Agreement be developed in Wigan Borough?</p>
<p>Introduction<br>
  Wigan Borough has been a Round 1 LAA since 2005 (one of the first in the country). 
  The current agreement ends on 31 March 2008 and we are now in the process of 
  developing the new version. We have learned a lot over the past three years 
  and it has led to many positive outcomes for local people and partners. </p>
<p>LAA's have evolved over the past few years. The recent White Paper, &quot;Strong 
  and Prosperous Communities&quot; puts them clearly at the centre of future relationships 
  between central, regional and local government. The Department of Communities 
  and Local Government (DCLG) have published guidance that sets out the process 
  for the next generation of LAA's, Developing the future arrangements for Local 
  Area Agreements February 2007 www.communities.gov.uk/ This paper summarises 
  the key points for information and discussion. </p>
<p>Negotiating a new LAA<br>
  &middot; LAAs will be the only place where central government will agree targets 
  with local authorities and their partners on outcomes delivered by local government 
  on its own or in partnership with others;</p>
<p>&middot; LAAs will no longer be about specific funding for specific targets. 
  They will now include all targets agreed with central government and the delivery 
  against the 35 + 18 improvement targets will be effectively supported by all 
  resources in the area.</p>
<p>&middot; There will be a new un ring fenced area based 'LAA' grant, with a 
  presumption that all area based funding would go through this route unless there 
  were very strong arguments for retaining a ring fence. This grant would have 
  no performance reporting or other conditions attached.&quot; <br>
  These major changes to LAA's will come into effect in April 2008 although the 
  fully revised performance indicator set is also not likely to be ready until 
  2009</p>
<p>The Comprehensive Area Assessment (CAA) that will assess the performance of 
  the Council and what it delivers in partnership is scheduled for introduction 
  in 2009. </p>
<p>Work is already underway locally to help understand what local priorities will 
  need to be included in the new LAA. This work will be developed with partners 
  across the Borough over the next few months (and will link closely to the revision 
  of the overall Community Plan.)<br>
  <br>
  What might be included in the new LAA?<br>
  It seems important to keep the goals of the Community Plan at the centre of 
  the LAA. <br>
  This means that the Community Plan also needs to be updated to ensure it still 
  reflects local aspirations.</p>
<p>There will be four LAA Themes,<br>
  &middot; Children and Young People<br>
  &middot; Healthier Communities and Older People<br>
  &middot; Economic Development and the Environment - including cultural issues<br>
  &middot; Safer and Stronger Communities</p>
<p>Once we have agreed our own local priorities and targets we will then negotiate 
  with Government Office North West around 35 improvement priorities. Targets 
  will need to reflect our priorities for improvement whatever theme they fall 
  into and we will not be required to have a set number in each. We will be required 
  to include an additional 18 statutory DfES targets in the LAA. (This process 
  will be subject to a risk assessment)</p>
<p>Future funding arrangements<br>
  The LSP is keen to ensure that we use a variety of funding streams to deliver 
  the national indicators - mainstream, ring fenced grants, non ring fenced and 
  so on. <br>
  It is anticipated that there may be some limited area based LAA grant. It is 
  possible that this may be available to be used as required to address priorities 
  that require additional support or investment or where other support not available. 
</p>
<p>Wigan currently receives a performance reward grant (PRG) for the Local Public 
  Service Agreement 2 (LPSA2) targets contained in the LAA. It is not certain 
  if this reward grant will be a feature in the future LAA funding. </p>
<p>Lead local authorities - what will be expected?<br>
  Local Authorities like Wigan will have a duty to produce a LAA in consultation 
  with named partners and anyone else they feel is appropriate. Statutory guidance 
  will make it clear that this includes voluntary, community and private sector 
  representatives (which cannot be specified using legislation). <br>
</p>
<p><br>
  Named partners currently include: <br>
  &middot; Local Authorities &middot; Joint Waste Disposal Authorities<br>
  &middot; Primary Care Trusts &middot; The Learning and Skills Council<br>
  &middot; Natural England &middot; Sport England<br>
